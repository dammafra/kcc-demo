# Demo Steps
In the very first part of the demo we will explore the basic concepts of kubernetes (ie [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), [ReplicationControllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/), [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) and [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)).Then, we will deploy and manage our application.
